# Hyderabadi Veg Dum Biryani Recipe

Making Hyderabadi Veg Dum Biryani is a delightful cooking process that combines fragrant basmati rice with mixed vegetables and aromatic spices. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Ingredients

**For the Rice:**
- 2 cups basmati rice
- 4 cups water
- 2-3 cloves
- 1 bay leaf
- 1-inch cinnamon stick
- Salt, to taste

**For the Vegetables:**
- 2 tablespoons ghee or oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 onions, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
- 1 cup mixed vegetables (e.g., carrots, peas, potatoes, and beans), diced
- 1/2 cup yogurt
- 2 tablespoons biryani masala
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder
- Salt, to taste

**For Layering:**
- A pinch of saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk
- 2 tablespoons fried onions
- Fresh coriander leaves, chopped
- Fresh mint leaves, chopped

## Instructions

1. **Rinse and Soak the Rice:**
   - Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
   - Soak it in water for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Cook the Rice:**
   - In a pot, bring water to a boil with cloves, bay leaf, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.
   - Add the soaked rice, cook until it's 70% cooked, and then drain.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - Heat ghee or oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
   - Add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.
   - Stir in ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a couple of minutes.
   - Add mixed vegetables and cook until they are slightly tender.
   - Stir in yogurt, biryani masala, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the vegetables are well-coated with the spices.

4. **Layer the Biryani:**
   - In a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker, spread half of the cooked vegetables.
   - Cover with half of the cooked rice.
   - Sprinkle half of the saffron milk, fried onions, mint leaves, and coriander leaves.
   - Repeat the layer with the remaining vegetables and rice, and top with the remaining garnishes.

5. **Dum Cooking:**
   - Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can also use dough to seal the edges to trap the steam.
   - Cook on low flame for 15-20 minutes. This allows the flavors to blend and the rice to complete its cooking.

6. **Serve:**
   - Remove the lid, fluff the biryani gently with a fork.
   - Serve hot with raita or a side salad.

## Tips

- You can add cashews or raisins for added richness.
- Adjust spices according to your taste preference.
- Be careful when mixing the layers to maintain the texture.
